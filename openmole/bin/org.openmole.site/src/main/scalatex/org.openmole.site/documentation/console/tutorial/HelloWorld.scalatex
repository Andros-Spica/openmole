@sect{An OpenMOLEÂ Hello World!}
  To demonstrate OpenMOLE console we will design a workflow that explore one variable multiplies it by 2 and then display each result. The computation is executed on multi-threaded environment.

  @br @hl.openmole("""
  val i = Val[Double]
  val res = Val[Double]

  val exploration = ExplorationTask(i in (0.0 to 100.0 by 1.0))
  val model =
    ScalaTask("val res = i * 2") set (
      inputs += i,
      outputs += (i, res)
    )

  val ex = exploration -< (model on LocalEnvironment(4) hook ToStringHook()) start
  """)
