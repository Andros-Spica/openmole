@sect{The Market Place}
    This is the OpenMOLE Market Place. It gathers working examples of OpenMOLE workflow. You can contribute to the market place either by providing a pull request on the OpenMOLE on the @a("central OpenMOLE market place on github", href := "https://github.com/openmole/openmole-market") or by providing your example workflows on your own git repository and post it to the user mailing list.
    @p To contribute to the market place you should provide self-contained working examples. All resources needed to execute the workfow should be located in a single directory. One or several @i("oms") files can be provided and a README.md must explain what the workflow computes. A workflow is included in this section only if it compiles within the matching OpenMOLE version.
