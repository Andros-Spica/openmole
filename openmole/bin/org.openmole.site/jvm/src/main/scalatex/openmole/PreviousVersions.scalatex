@h1{0.6 | Mostly Magic}

Long time, no release! More than a year!
The OpenMOLE team is very proud to disclose "Mostly Magic", the 6th major version of OpenMOLE.
As a reminder OpenMOLE is a software for parameter exploration, optimisation, data processing which allow a simple access to large scale distributed execution environments. It has been designed to be useful for a wide range of users and is usable even for people with no knowledge in distributed computing.

@p
What's new?

@ul
  @li{A new task has been introduced, the CARETask. It makes it easier than ever to run your applications and their dependencies (C, Python, R, ...) in OpenMOLE The access to EGI is now base on DIRAC and webdav. It is more reliable, more scalable an more efficient}
  @li{A Path type is now available in samplings to avoid copying files over local networks (use with Clusters and shared file systems only, not on EGI)}
  @li{Authentications are now tested when they are created. Valid authentications methods are marked with a green OK tag and can be used in the workflow}
  @li{The optimisation methods have been redesigned to be easier to use}
  @li{A new import wizard is here to ease the integration of your programs in OpenMOLE}
  @li{The file browser of the GUI has been revamped and its now fast and handy}
  @li{The execution panel has been widely improved.}
  @li{A new democratic (or is it?) process to decide on the release name :)}

@p
What's to come in next release?
@p
First we plan to avoid as much as possible the long release cycles such as this one, we will make our best to shorten the release cycle of OpenMOLE to a few months.
A new website is under development (thanks Paul & Etienne aka jQuery team)
The documentation will be emporered with a search function in the documentation (thanks Julien!!!)
A new ContainerTask will offer support for Docker / OCI containers
A modular OpenMOLE, with additional plugins enabled on demand
Improvement of the interface to be even more user friendly, with more tooltips and integrated help.

@p
A multi-user version that you can install on a server and be used by several user at the same time
The possibility to delegate computation to cloud provider such as Amazon, Azure... and cloud middleware such as open stack.

  @li{CARE required a kernel version greater than 3.2 which is no suitable for grid executions. A new version as been released and linked in the doc which depends on the Linux kernel 2.6.32.}
  @li{The CARETask was failing on some systems due to argument parsing.}
  @li{The market entries using CARE archives were failing due to a missing execution permission.}
  @li{The authentication add panel had no cancel button.}
