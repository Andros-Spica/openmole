@h2{What is OpenMOLE ?}



@h2{What can I use it for ?}



@h2{Background and Context}

Ce qu'on attend des utilisateurs + fixer le vocabulaire usuel d'OpenMOLE

OpenMOLE targets simulation model analysis, by performing experiments
These experiments are described by some scripts, called @i{worfklows} (a sequence of @i{Tasks}).



Models are seen as particular machines, programs , function that transform @b{inputs} into @b{outputs}.

Inputs can be of several types : @b{parameters} (Double, Integer, Boolean, String) , @b{data} (files).
Outputs are basically the same : Valued measures (Double, Integer, Boolean, String) , @b{date} (typically .csv files).


@h2{Installing OpenMOLE on your computer}

@h3{Try our demo website}
Before downloading OpenMOLE, you might want to get a preview of what you can do with it.
You can try OpenMOLE online using our @a("demo website", href := shared.link.demo).
Please note that the service is reset every 6 hours, so don't be surprised if your current script suddenly vanishes :-)

@h3{Download OpenMOLE}
To run correctly on your own computer, OpenMOLE requires Java version 8 or above.
Check our @a("FAQ", href := Pages.faq.file) to access your java version information.
@br
When Java is installed, you just need to download and extract @a("this archive", href:=Resource.script.openmole.file), and
you're done! OpenMOLE is installed and works out of the box!

@h3{Run OpenMOLE on Linux}
You can then launch OpenMOLE by executing the @i{openmole} file in the installation directory with the @hl.code("./openmole") command.
It will bring up you web browser.
@br
OpenMOLEÂ supports Chrome and Firefox.
If you are using another default web browser, please copy paste the OpenMOLE url (http://localhost:port) in one of these browsers.
@br
@br
You should see something like this:

@h2{Get help}

To get help you are more than welcome to contact the OpenMOLE user mailing list. To do so, you should
@aa("subscribe here", href := shared.link.mailingList), and then you can post your question to the list users.
We're also present on the @b{#openmole} channel of the @aa("ISC-PIF's RocketChat", href := shared.link.chat).
