@h3{What is OpenMOLE?}

@div(stylesheet.centerJustify(100)){
  OpenMOLE has been developed since 2008 as a @b{free and open-source} platform.
@br
  OpenMOLE offers tools to run, explore, diagnose and optimize your numerical model, taking advantage of distributed computing environments.
  @br
  With OpenMOLE you can @b{embed your already developed model}, in any language (Java, Binary exe, NetLogo, R, SciLab, Python, C++...).
}

@div(stylesheet.centerJustify(100)){
  OpenMOLE comes with a graphical user interface (GUI) to write @b{scripts around your model}.
  These scripts will use OpenMOLE methods to @b{explore} your model and @b{distribute} its execution on High Performing Computing (HPC) environments, with only a few lines of code!
}


@h3{What can I use it for?}
@div(stylesheet.centerJustify(100)){

    @i{Real} sensitivity analysis, Calibration on mono or multi criterion, Pattern diversity research in model dynamics, Custom design of experiments, Data processing.
}
@Main.build

@p
    Simulation models can be abstracted as a program (or function) that transforms a set of @b{inputs} into a set of @b{outputs}.
@br

    @img(src := Resource.img.method.modelIO.file, stylesheet.center(40))
@br
    Inputs are various : parameters , pictures, CSV files, DB connections, etc., most of the time, modelers are interested in  @b{parameters space exploration} for sensitivity analysis or calibration.
@br
    Likewise, outputs can be values are most of times @b{measures}, computed on the dynamics produced by a simulation run  (e.g. fitness or error functions).
@br
    In the following, we will refer to @b{input space} and @b{output space}. OpenMOLE provides methods to conveniently explore these spaces and help you answer original questions about your model (cf. TODO link explore)
@br
    The resulting output of a simulation, for a given input, will sometimes be referred as the @b{image} of the input.
    Likewise, the parameters corresponding to an image are called @b{origins} or @b{ancestors}.


@h3{Wanna try?}

@div(stylesheet.centerJustify(100)){
  You can try OpenMOLE online using the OpenMOLEÂ @a("demonstration website", href := shared.link.demo).
@br
  When you are ready you can then download OpenMOLE and install it on your computer, everything is explained in the @a("Download", href := install.file) section.
@br
  Have a look at the @a("Getting Started", href := stepByStepIntro.file) section, check out the @a("GUI guide", href := gui.file), dive into the @a("documentation", href := documentationHead.file), and lastly explore some @a("advanced concepts", href := advancedConcepts.file).
@br
  There is also a full @a("site map", href := siteMap.file) to see all the resources on the website.
