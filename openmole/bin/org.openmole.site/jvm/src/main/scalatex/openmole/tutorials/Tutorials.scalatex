In this section you will find some tutorials to help you build your first experiments.
Feel free to suggest topics for new tutorials you would find helpful on the @aa("forum", href := shared.link.mailingList).

You can even write your own tutorial and share it with the OpenMOLE community on the forum!
We'll make sure to integrate it with the next release.
