PSE (Pattern Space Exploration) method is used to explore the output's diversity of a model.
Input parameter values are selected to produce new output values, such that as the exploration progresses, the region of
the output space that is covered gets bigger. PSE reveals the potential of your model: the
variety of the dynamics it is able to produce, even those about which you were not investigating in the first place !

@b{Method scores:}

@br

The PSE method is designed to cover the output space, hence the highest score possible in output exploration.
PSe is all about @i{covering} output space, hence the low scores in optimization and Input Space exploration.
As the methods discovers patterns in the output space, inputs values that lead to these patterns are available, that give litlle insights
about the model sensitivity.
Contrarily to calibration-based methods, PSE is sensitive to the dimensionality of the @b{output} space, as it maintains an archive
of the output space locations covered ever since, which is rapidly costly for more than 3-4 dimensions.
@br
PSE handles stochasticity in the sense that the selected pattern are estimated by the median of several model execution output values.

@p
    The PSE method searches for diverse output values. As with all
    evolutionary algorithms, PSE generates new individuals through
    a combination of genetic inheritance from parent individuals
    and mutation. PSE (inspired by @a("novelty search", href := shared.link.noveltySearch)) selects for
    the parents whose output values are rare compared to the rest of
    the population and to the previous generations. In order to evaluate
    the rarity of a the output values, PSE discretises the output space,
    dividing it into cells. Each time a simulation is run and its output
    is known, a counter is incremented in the corresponding cell. PSE
    preferentially selects the parents whose associated cells have
    low counters. By selecting parents with rare output values, we try and increase the
    chances to produce new individuals with previously unobserved
    behaviours.


@p
    PSE takes the following parameters:
@ul
    @li{@hl.code("genome"): the model parameters, varying  within their minimum and maximum bounds,}
    @li{@hl.code("objectives"): the observables measured for each simulation and within which we search for diversity, with a discretization step ,}
    @li{@hl.code("stochastic"): the seed generator, which generates suitable seeds for the method. Mandatory if your model contains randomness. The generated seed for the model task is transmitted through the variable give as an argument of Replication (here myseed).}

@p
  You will also need an evolutionary scheme and can use SteadyStateEvolution as described in @a("Calibration", href :=
  DocumentationPages.calibration.file))

@p To use PSE as the exploration method in openmole, use the PSE constructor like so:
@br @hl.openmole("""
//seed declaration for random number generation
val myseed =Val[Int]

val exploration =
    PSE (
      genome =
        Seq(
          param1  in (0.0, 1.0),
          param2 in (-10.0, 10.0)),
      objectives =
        Seq(
          output1 in (0.0 to 40.0 by 5.0),
          output2 in (0.0 to 4000.0 by 50.0)),
      stochastic = Stochastic(seed = myseed)
    )

val evolution =
    SteadyStateEvolution(
      algorithm = exploration,
      evaluation = modelTask,
      parallelism = 10,
      termination = 100 
    )""",header=model, name = "PSE")
where @hl.code("param1") and @hl.code("param2") are inputs
of the task that runs the model, and @hl.code("output1") and
@hl.code("output2") are outputs of that same task. The number
of inputs and outputs are illimited.
@p
    Note that the method is subject
    to the curse of dimensionality on the output space, meaning that the
    number of output patterns can grow as a power of the number of output
    variables. With more than just a few output variables, the search space
    may become so big that the search will take too long to complete and the
    search results will take more memory than one can handle on a modern
    computer. Restricting the number of output variables to 2 or 3 also
    facilitates the interpretation of the results, making them easy to visualise.
