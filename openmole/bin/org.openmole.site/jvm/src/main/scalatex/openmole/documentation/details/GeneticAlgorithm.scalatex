@h1{Genetic Algorithms in OpenMOLE}

OpenMOLE make an intensive use of genetic algorithms (GA) in its various @a("methods", href:= DocumentationPages.method.file) : whereas it deals with model calibration (which is an optimization problem) or a diversity of outputs     research like in @a("PSE", href:= DocumentationPages.pse.file) (which boils down to Genetic algorithms with a novelty incentive).

    @br@br
    GAs can be smartly distributed on grid environments using @a("islands scheme", href:= DocumentationPages.island.file), and and be able to deal with model @a("stochasticity", href:=DocumentationPages.stochasticity.file) .




@sect{About Calibration and GA }
    OpenMOLE provides advanced methods to help you calibrate your model.
    These methods automatically generate workflows to explore your model's parameter space towards the best parameter
    set according to a previously defined @b{goal} (or @b{objective} or @b{criterion}) .
    This is commonly addressed in literature as a calibration/optimization methods.

    @p
    Calibration methods of OpenMOLE use Genetic Algorithms to explore the parameter space of a simulation model, looking for parameter sets that will produce outputs  that reach one or several given @b{objectives}.

    @b{Objectives functions},also called @b{fitness functions}, compute quantities from model outputs that have to be minimized or maximized ; they're a quantification of the characteristics of what is the @i{optimal model output} according to what  you're looking for.

    @br@br

    One common use case is optimization to fit some data. Objective function could be
    a distance function between simulation results and data ; a classical example is the Squared Error function.
    @br

    If you want your model to reproduce several characteristics (sometimes called stylised facts), you need
    several objectives, each of them quantifying the similarity between your model outputs
    and the characteristics you want to reproduce.

    @p
    To calibrate your model, you need to define:

     @ul
        @li
            the @b{genome} of your model, i.e. the parameters to be calibrated. They are the dimensions of the parameter
             space that will be explored by the genetic algorithm. GA will try different genomes, and keep the best
             discovered ever since.
        @li
            the @b{objectives} you want to reach, expressed as  variables to be @b{minimized}.
        @li
            a @b{termination criterion}, to stop the method eventually

@sect{Dummy Model Optimization Example}

    This workflow optimises a dummy model using the generational NSGA II multi-objective algorithm. You can replace the instances of @i{model} by your own model and adapt the variation range of its input variables. If you're not familiar with parameter tuning using Genetic Algorithms (GA), you should first consult the @aa("tutorial explaining how to calibrate a NetLogo model with a GA", href := DocumentationPages.netLogoGA.file).

    @br
    Notice that the objectives are given as a sequence of model outputs variables to @b{minimize}.
So if you want to reach specific target values, like Pi and 42  you can use the DeltaTask an plug it after your model:

  $model

  val evolution =
    SteadyStateEvolution(
      // Definition of the optimisation algorithm

    )""", name = "nsga2 delta example")
    @br
    NB: in this case the results in the saved file in will be the difference between the outputs of the model and your objectives.
    @br

    @br
    Obviously, maximization problem are performed by taking the opposite of variables as objectives. You may use a ScalaTask in place of the DeltaTask to perform such a small computations in the workflow.
