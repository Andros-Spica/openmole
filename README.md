[OpenMOLE](http://www.openmole.org) (Open MOdeL Experiment) is a workflow engine designed to leverage the computing power of distributed execution environments for naturally parallel processes. A process is told naturally parallel if the same computation runs many times for a set of different inputs, such as model experiment or data processing, ...

## OpenMOLE by example ##

Imagine that you want to understand and/or optimize some parameters of an executable that you generally set in an empirical or arbitrary manner. 
Then embed the executable in OpenMOLE (*5 minutes*), use one of the distributed genetic algorithms provided by OpenMOLE (*5 minutes*) and launch the workflow on a distributed execution environment with thousands of machines (*1 minute*).

To summarize, you can **design large scale distributed programs** reusing **legacy code** and advanced numeric methods in approximately **10 minutes**.

## Try it! ##

To checkout OpenMOLE you can play with to the [demo site](http://demo.openmole.org) (this site is wiped out every two hours). You should click on the little cart and try out some of the market place examples.

## OpenMOLE Features: ##

  - **Expressive workflows** – Graphical and textual (**Domain Specific Language**) workflow system to describe naturally parallel processes,
  - **Transparent distributed computing** – Zero-deployment (no installation step) approach to distribute the workload transparently on your multi-core machines, desktop-grids, clusters, grids, ...
  - **Works with your programs** – Embed user’s executables (**Java, Binary exe, NetLogo, R, Scilab, Python, C++, ...**),
  - **Scalable** – Handles millions of tasks and TB of data,
  - **Advanced methods** – Advanced numerical experiments (design of experiments, stochastic replication, calibration, sensitivity analysis, ...),
  - **Mature** – Developed since 2008, used in many real world applications and for daily production by many scientists.
