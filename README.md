[OpenMOLE](http://www.openmole.org) (Open MOdeL Experiment) is a workflow engine designed to leverage the computing power of distributed execution environments for naturally parallel processes. A process is told naturally parallel if the same computation runs many times for a set of different inputs, such as model experiment or data processing, ...

## OpenMOLE by example ##

Imagine that you want to understand and/or optimize some parameters of an executable that you generally fix in an empirical or arbitrary manner. Then embed the executable in OpenMOLE (5 minutes), use one of the distributed genetic algorithms provided by OpenMOLE (5 minutes) and resulting launch the workflow on a distributed execution environment with thousands of machines (1 minutes). To sumarize, you can design large scale distributed programs reusing legacy code and advanced numeric methods in approximately 10 minutes.

## OpenMOLE Features: ##

  - **Expressive workflows** – Graphical and textual (**Domain Specific Language**) workflow system to describe naturally parallel processes,  
  - **Transparent distributed computing** – Zero-deployment (no installation step) approach to distribute the workload transparently on your multi-core machines, desktop-grids, clusters, grids, ...  
  - **Works with your programs** – Embed user’s executables (**Java, Binary exe, NetLogo, R, Scilab, Python, C++, ...**),  
  - **Scalable** – Handles millions of tasks and TB of data,  
  - **Model analysis** – Advanced numerical experiments on simulation models (design of experiments, stochastic model replication, calibration, sensitivity analysis, ...),  
  - **Mature** – Developed since 2008, used in many real world applications and for daily production by many scientists.
